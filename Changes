mini_httpd: server does not support RFC 5746, see CVE-2009-3555

To Do: User+Passwd --> Authorization Required

To do:
    - Wishlist of built-in attributes
      1. HTTP method (GET, POST, HEAD, etc.)
      2. Full URL including the hostname part (currently only local URL is passed)
      3. Indication of which virtual server
      4. If SOAP, the name of the first direct child element of the SOAP Body
      5. Any SOAP Action header, from SOAP message or from HTTP header.
    - (Local) logout should either return to referer, or to configurable page
    - Depend logging in validate, az response, emit logging in decorate, azreq
    - Static linking, dynamic linking libzxid
    - IdP initiated SLO
    - IdP should include URL for correcting information
    - Add persona support to IdP
    - Add attribute editor support to IdP

    - Support Danish profiles: http://digitaliser.dk/resource/516724
    - Support http://saml2int.org/ (interoperability profile and club)

    - Rule names by URN or URL to be logged to ab
    - mod_auth_saml_ws module
    - Using Apache frontend todo TAS3 for java apps
    - PDS with DITA (OASIS)
    - Partial XML parsing: stop after header
      - Header removal / unwrapping vs. header extraction, but still passing through
    - Pentaho investigation, use dwh as the backing store of the PDS
    - The FEDUSERNAME attribute should include both succinct EntityID
      and the persistent pseudonym. Also, make mail interface for this
      to work (run a script that fishes the stuff out).

To do from EIC 2012:
    - Scopes in AuthnRequests
    - SAML2INT.org profiles, including branding icons
    = http://openidtest.uninett.no/connect-provider
    - http://tinyurl.com/umav1
    - osis.idcommons.net

Regarding mod_perl stability: I would assume most of that has to do
with underlying memory allocator. All allocation activity in zxid code
goes through zx_alloc() (in zxlib.c:55). I should fix zx_alloc() to use it.
Anyway, all this is in place to ensure that you could replace malloc()
with an alternative allocator, such as Apache pool allocator.

In playing with allocators, important caveat: OpenSSL has similar
vectorable allocator. You should use same allocator for OpenSSL and
ZXID (and perl). libcurl documentation is not entirely clear regarding
its allocator usage, but I assume it uses malloc() so that would be
yet another worry.

Google Apps Integration
http://code.google.com/googleapps/domain/sso/saml_reference_implementation.html
Here are example docs for SimpleSAMLPHP, or Shibboleth:
* http://simplesamlphp.org/docs/1.5/simplesamlphp-googleapps
* https://shibboleth.usc.edu/docs/google-apps/

    - SP attr token: special attribute at IdP. The token is issued by the SP to
      pass in reliable way attributes to SP. Signed to tie to pseudonym.
    - Use SAML2 a7n as "sticky policy" envelope, standardizing some attribute names to convey metadata such as acceptable use or purpose, obligations, right-of-access-correction-and-deletion-URL, and the authorative source.
    - zxcot should have idpdimd listing mode
    - zxpasswd should have user federation listing mode
    - zxid_pw_authn() should not report scary error when checking .ykspent in not spent case
    - zxid_select_tgt() (?)
    - X509 attr certs (some code is in place, but does not work correctly)
    - Use post screen as confirmation screen, option for federation confirmation question
    - Config option for redirection after SLO
    - WSP_LOCALPDP_OBL_REQ processing
    - WSC_LOCALPDP_OBL_ACCEPT processing
    - IdP: Display Relay State in hopes of giving user more context
    - IdP: Interpret the attribute request authn ctx query string approach and show
      to the user what attributes were requested by the SP.
    - IdP: If SP does not specify attribute list, display "SP did not request any
      specific attributes. Only authentication and default attributes will be sent."
    - AuthnReq QS option for SP to request that consent is explicitly seeked
    - AuthnReq QS option for SP to request that attribute list is not shown up front
    - Consider removing zx_scan_pi_or_comment() from most tags, only leaving for top level.
    - Show whether SP wants a persistent or transient, or some other type of Id for the user.
    - Clarify signature validation error codes, e.g. <SignedInfo> canon fail vs. bad cert
    - Instantiation of declared prefix that only appears in innards of the XML (e.g. xs)
    - Merge Jeroen's mega patch
    - Idea: authorization through interaction service, get it logged to audit trail as evidence
    - Idea: discovery and consent questions up-front in the beginning of the business process
    - Improve 2 factor authn: the pin should be a hashed password
    - Paper scratch list based OTP
    - Coordinates based authn (challenge response)
    - Changing QR code based OTP
    - AuthnCtx comparison or matching
    - Proxy IdP AuthnCtx, RequesterID mapping
    - Config option to turn off audience restriction
    - U-Prove (https://connect.microsoft.com/site1188  /t/U-Prove_CTP_R2_Whitepaper.pdf) support
    - Idemix support http://www.zurich.ibm.com/security/idemix/
    - AuthnSvc (AS) should check caller credential, in addition to the login credential, see comment on AS_ENA in zxidconf.h
    - Add support for multiple $ separated button_url's, see zxidmeta.c:zxid_org_desc()
    - IdP CDC registration support: in IdP login screen, display 1x1.gif from the CDC domain
    - Per SP User Data Key (udk) support (generated by IdP on per SP basis, distinct from
      pseudonym, and used by SP to encrypt and decrypt the SP local data about user. SP pledges
      by policy to not store the udk anywhere locally. Thus SP will be able to handle
      udk only when it has received it during session from the IdP (or discovery?) (solve
      problem of it being kept in audit trail, such as in logged signed message)
    - Slow mode: pause for 2 seconds on every web service call and offer user
      opportunity to interact
    - Delegation to job coaches
    - Distressed authentication, persona selection at authentication by using prefix (pin)
    - Support BrowserID https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/persona
    - BUG: Passing qs args in RelayState
    - BANGBANG_PAT to enable bang bang expansion of outputs, even in mini_httpd_zxid

    - l0 causes pr_ix == 0 error at zxidpsso.c:196, at least on Marcin's machine
    - Upgrade zxid_psobj_enc() and zxid_psobj_dec() to AES256GCM
