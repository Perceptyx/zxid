# Change log, minor credits, and release history

Usual suspects: zxid.user@lists.unh.edu

To do:
    - Add Trust and Privacy Negotiation capability to discovery
    - Wishlist of built-in attributes
      1. HTTP method (GET, POST, HEAD, etc.)
      2. Full URL including the hostname part (currently only local URL is passed)
      3. Indication of which virtual server
      4. If SOAP, the name of the first direct child element of the SOAP Body
      5. Any SOAP Action header, from SOAP message or from HTTP header.
    - (Local) logout should either return to referer, or to configurable page
    - Depend logging validate, az response, emit logging decorate, azreq
    - Brian's ordering problem (risaris-bad.xml)
    - Static linking, dynamic linking libzxid
    - IdP initiated SLO
    - IdP should include URL for correcting information
    - Add persona support to IdP
    - Add attribute editor support to IdP

    - Support Danish profiles: http://digitaliser.dk/resource/516724
    - Support http://saml2int.org/ (interoperability profile and club)

Regarding mod_perl stability: I would assume most of that has to do
with underlying memory allocator. All allocation activity in zxid code
goes through zx_alloc() (in zxlib.c:55). The ctx->malloc_func function
pointer is not currently used. I should fix zx_alloc() to use it.
Anyway, all this is in place to ensure that you could replace malloc()
with an alternative allocator, such as Apache pool allocator.

In playing with allocators, important caveat: OpenSSL has similar
vectorable allocator. You should use same allocator for OpenSSL and
ZXID (and perl). libcurl documentation is not entirely clear regarding
its allocator usage, but I assume it uses malloc() so that would be
yet another worry.

Google Apps Integration
http://code.google.com/googleapps/domain/sso/saml_reference_implementation.html
Here are example docs for SimpleSAMLPHP, or Shibboleth:
* http://simplesamlphp.org/docs/1.5/simplesamlphp-googleapps
* https://shibboleth.usc.edu/docs/google-apps/

    - Use SAML2 a7n as "sticky policy" envelope, standardizing some attribute names to convey metadata such as acceptable use or purpose, obligations, right-of-access-correction-and-deletion-URL, and the authorative source.
    - zxcot should have idpdimd listing mode
    - zxpasswd should have user federation listing mode
    - zxid_pw_authn() should not report scary error when checking .ykspent in not spent case
    - zxid_select_tgt() (?)
    - Each credential as its own a7n
    - X509 attr certs
    - Use post screen as confirmation screen, option for federation confirmation question
    - If generic XML content is seen as attribute value, it should be reserialized as safe_base64 so it can be returned to app layer as attribute (e.g. via LDIF).
    - Config option for redirection after SLO
    - WSP_LOCALPDP_OBL_REQ processing
    - WSC_LOCALPDP_OBL_ACCEPT processing
    - IdP: Display Relay State in hopes of giving user more context
    - IdP: Interpret the attribute request authn ctx query string approach and show
      to the user what attributes were requested by the SP.
    - IdP: If SP does not specify attribute list, display "SP did not request any
      specific attributes. Only authentication and default attributes will be sent."
    - AuthnReq QS option for SP to request that consent is explicitly seeked
    - AuthnReq QS option for SP to request that attribute list is not shown up front
    - Consider removing zx_scan_pi_or_comment() from most tags, only leaving for top level.
    - Show whether SP wants a persistent or transient, or some other type of Id for the user.
    - Sort unknown attributes wrt known attributes in SO and WO enc
    - Add MessageID and InReplyTo headers to discovery queries.
    - zxpasswd account creation problems
        echo -n tas3 | ~/zxid/zxpasswd -at 'cn: Mallory McBean$givenname: Mallory$sn: McBeanBean$o: Laskenta Keskus$eduPersonEntitlement: admin$' -c mallory
