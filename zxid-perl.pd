1 Introduction
==============

Perl access to ZXID is using Net::SAML module.

The perl glue for ZXID was generated using swig(1), however, the swig
interface is not a retrofit: the whole ZXID API was designed to
be easily swiggifiable.

The main aim of the glue is supporting the easy and simple API, see
<<link:zxid-simple.html: zxid_simple()>> for general
reference. Only differences and language specifics are covered in this
document.

6 Net::SAML Perl Module
=======================

<<fi: >>

* perl CGI example: zxid.pl
* using with mod_perl

After building the main zxid tree, you can

  cd Net
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test      # Tests are extremely sparse at the moment
  make install

This assumes you use the pregenerated Net/SAML_wrap.c and Net/SAML.pm files
that we distribute. If you wish to generate these files from origin,
you need to have SWIG installed and then say in main zxid directory

  make perlmod ENA_GEN=1  # Makes all available perl modules (including heavy low level ones)
  make samlmod ENA_GEN=1  # Only makes Net::SAML (much faster)
  make wsfmod  ENA_GEN=1  # Only makes Net::WSF (much faster)

>  WARNING: Low level interface is baroque, and consequently, it
>  will take a lot of disk space, RAM and CPU to build it: 100 MB
>  would not be exaggeration and over an hour (on 1GHz CPU). Build
>  time memory consumption of single cc1 process will be over
>  256 MB of RAM. You have been warned.

This example only demosntrates SSO.

Lines 1-5 set up the configuration. See zxid-conf.pd for guidance.

ll.6-7 reads in the CGI input the perl way.

l.8 runs the SAML engine of ZXID. The engine will return result that
is processed below. The magic constant 0x1828 sets some flags, see
zxid-simple.pd for explanation. This explanation may be especially relevant
if you plan to run as mod_perl process rather than as a CGI. With
these flags you could eliminate the need to render the IdP selection
screen.

ll.9-13: interpret the return value. l.10 deals with parts of SAML
protocol that need redirect or content. l.12 deals with rendering the
IdP selection screen. This screen replaces the traditional login
screen in most applications.

l.15 demonstrates how to extract attributes from the return value. The ret
is formatted as LDIF so it is very easy to parse with perl.

ll.17-30 render the "protected content". Most protected content should
contain also Single Logout button. This is accomplished on l.29.
Protected content is where your normal application after SSO lives.
You can rely in ZXID session mechanism and just show the content,
or you could bootstrap your application's session mechanism here.

ll.32-67 render the "idp selection" screen. This could have been
automatically generated has the flags to Net::SAML::simple_cf()
been different (see zxid-simple.pd for explanation).

As can be seen, the most central logic for SSO is only about 10 lines. The
rest is user interface.

6.2 Current major modules are
-----------------------------

* Net::SAML - The high level interfaces for Single Sign-On (SSO)
* Net::SAML::Raw - Low level assertion and protocol manipulation interfaces
* Net::SAML::Metadata - Low level metadata manipulation interfaces

6.3 Planned modules
-------------------

* Net::WSF - The high level interfaces for Web Services Frameworks (WSF)
* Net::WSF::Raw - The low level interfaces for WSF variants
* Net::WSF::WSC - The high level interfaces for Web Services Clients
* Net::WSF::WSC:Raw

6.4 Perl API Adaptations
------------------------

The perl APIs were generated from the C .h files using SWIG. Generally any
C functions and constants that start by zxid_, ZXID_, SAML2_, or SAML_
have that prefix changed to <<tt: Net::SAML::>>. Note, however, that
the zx_ prefix is not stripped.

Since ZXID wants to keep strings in many places in length + data
representation, namely as ~struct zx_str~, SWIG typemaps were used
to make this happen automatically. Thus any C function that takes as
an argument <<tt: struct zx_str*>> can take a perl string
directly. Similarly any C function that returns such a pointer, will
return a perl string instead. As a final goodie, any C function, such
as

  struct zx_str* zx_ref_len_str(struct zx_ctx* c, int len, char* s);

that takes ~length~ and <<tt: s>> as explicit arguments, takes only single
argument that is a perl string (the one argument automatically satisfies
two C arguments, thanks to a type map). The above could be called like

  $a = Net::SAML::zx_ref_len_str(c, "foo");

First the "foo" satisfies both ~len~ and ~s~, and then the return value
is converted back to perl string.

6.5 Testing Net::SAML and zxid.pl as CGI script
-----------------------------------------------

To test the perl module, you must restart the mini_httpd(8) so
that it recognizes zxid.pl as CGI script:

  mini_httpd -p 8443 -c zxid.pl -S -E zxid.pem

Then start browsing from

  https://sp1.zxidsp.org:8443/zxid.pl

or if you want to avoid the common domain cookie check

  https://sp1.zxidsp.org:8443/zxid.pl?o=E

6.6 Testing Net::SAML and zxid.pl under mod_perl
------------------------------------------------

You can run zxid.pl under mod_perl using the Apache::Registry
module. See <<link:apache.html: Apache recipe>> for how
to compile Apache to support mod_perl. After configuration
it should work the same as the CGI approach.

<<ignore:
[Sat Nov 14 12:13:55 2009] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] failed to resolve handler `ModPerl::Registry': Can't locate ModPerl/Registry.pm in @INC (@INC contains: /usr/local/lib/perl5/5.8.4/i686-linux /usr/local/lib/perl5/5.8.4 /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.4/i686-linux /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.4 /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl . /apps/apache/2.2.3) at (eval 2) line 3.\n
>>

6.7 Debugging Net::SAML with GDB
--------------------------------

As bizarre as it may sound, it is actually quite feasible to debug
libzxid and the SAML_wrap.c using GDB while in perl. For example

  cd zxid
  gdb /usr/local/bin/perl
  set env QUERY_STRING=o=E
  r ./zxid.pl

If the script crashes inside the C code, GDB will perfectly
reasonably take control, allowing you to see stack back-trace (bt)
and examine variables. Of course it helps if openssl and perl
were compiled with debug symbols (libzxid is compiled
with debug symbols by default), but even if they weren't you
can usually at least get some clue.

When preparing a perl module, generally Makefile.PL mechanism causes
the same compilation flags to be used as were used to compile the perl
itself. Generally this is good, but if libzxid was compiled with
different flags, mysterious errors can crop up. For example, I compile
my libzxid against openssl that I have also compiled myself. However, I
once had a bug where the perl had been compiled such that the Linux
distribution's incompatible openssl would be picked by perl compile
flags, resulting in mystery crashes deep inside openssl ASN.1 decoder
routines (c2i_ASN1_INTEGER() while in d2i_X509() to be exact). When I
issued `info files' in GDB I finally realized that I was using the
wrong openssl library.

97.1 Compilation Problems
-------------------------

97.1.4 Perl compiled with different compiler than zxid
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(*** also appears in README.zxid FAQ)

Perl modules generally want to be compiled with the same C compiler
and options as were used to compile perl itself (see perl -V). If this
happens to be different than the compiler you have defined in CC
variable (gcc by default, near top of Makefile or in localconf.mk), you may
get an error like:

  cd Net; perl Makefile.PL && make
  Warning: -L.. changed to -L/home/sampo/zxid/Net/..
  Writing Makefile for Net::SAML
  make[1]: Entering directory `/home/sampo/zxid/Net'
  cc -c  -I.. -I/apps/openssl/std/include -I/apps/include -D_REENTRANT -D_GNU_SOURCE -DTHREADS_HAVE_PIDS -DDEBUGGING -fno-strict-aliasing -pipe -Wdeclaration-after-statement -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -O2 -march=i586 -mtune=i686 -fmessage-length=0 -Wall -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -g -Wall -pipe   -DVERSION=\"\" -DXS_VERSION=\"\" -fPIC "-I/usr/lib/perl5/5.8.8/i586-linux-thread-multi/CORE"   SAML_wrap.c
  /bin/sh: cc: command not found
  make[1]: *** [SAML_wrap.o] Error 127
  make[1]: Leaving directory `/zxid/Net'
  make: *** [samlmod] Error 2

*Solutions*

1. Compile zxid with compiler that was used for perl, e.g.

     make CC=the-compiler-that-perl-wants

2. Recompile perl using the compiler that you want to use for zxid

3. Tinker with PATH environment variable so that both C compilers
   are found. However, using two different compilers is not really supported.

In general these types of problems happen when you use perl installed
by your distribution, but have later compiled a gcc of your own. It may
even be that you never installed the distribution cc - in that case
consider installing it and then trying approaches 1 or 3.

A similar situation can arise with incompatibility of the compiler and
options used for dependency libraries, such as OpenSSL or libcurl, and
those used for compiling zxid itself.

97.1.5 All files under zx missing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(*** also appears in README.zxid FAQ)

You need to symlink zx to zxid source directory, thus

  ln -s . zx

If you do not have it, then you will get a lot of file inclusion errors for
headers that are supposed to be in path starting by zx/

The symlink is there to keep all hand written source files on top
level of directory for ease of development, yet allow inclusions to go
through ~zx~ subdirectory. When zxid is installed, it goes to
/usr/include/zx. Hence the symlink keeps the includes the same whether
developing or using installed version.

97.1.6 Compiler Warnings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(*** also appears in README.zxid FAQ)

If you compile zxid with compiler warnings turned on (CFLAGS += -Wall),
you will see quite a number of warnings, most of which are
unwarranted. Since the warnings are unwarranted, I ship zxid Makefile
with warnings turned off. If this bothers you, feel free to investigate
the warnings and report to me any issues you uncover.

Following warnings in partuclar are unwarranted:

1. Any unusued variable warnings, especially in generated code. Most
   common of these is ~se~ variable (see enc-templ.c).
2. "Suggest parenthesis around assignment when used as truth value." I
   rely on C language operator precedence. Also, in most cases the
   assignment is the only expression in the truth test - there simply
   is no opportunity for ambiguity -- and no justified case for gcc to
   warn about this.
3. "Suggest parenthesis around && when used in ||". I rely on C
   language operator precedence, hence the suggestion is redundant.

Some warnings you may want to worry about

A. "int format, long int arg". On 32 bit platforms int and long
   are both 32 bits so this warning is not an issue. On 64 bit platforms,
   however, there may be cause for worry.

97.1.8 SWIG and Perl Problems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ZXID is tested and known to work with SWIG version 1.3.40. It is known not
to work with SWIG-2.0.4. The telltale sign is

  perl -MNet::SAML -e 'print Net::SAML::call($cf,$ses,$svctype,$url,0,0,$soap)'
  TypeError in method 'zxid_call', argument 5 of type 'char const *'

SWIG version should not be a concern for those using .tgz distributions of
ZXID as the tar gzip archives already contain the files generated by SWIG.
Also installs from cpan should not be affected.
