 * Most of the configuration options can be set via configuration

/*(c) VPATH - CPATH for a virtual server
 * The VPATH allows different configuration CPATH for different

 * If the config file <CPATH><VPATH>zxid.conf exists (i.e. /var/zxid/<VPATH>zxid.conf
 * when using default CPATH), then the CPATH configuration variable is changed
 * to point to the VPATH, and the virtual host specific config file is read.
 *
 * VPATH is rendered by first inserting current CPATH, unless VPATH starts by '/',
 * and then rendering each ordinary letter as is, but expanding the
 * following % (percent) specifications, inline:
 *
 *   %%  expands as single percent sign
 *   %a  access protocol prefix, e.g. "https://" or "http://"

 * VPATH is not really a configuration option on its own right (there is
 * no corresponding entry in struct zxid_conf), but rather a directive
 * that instructs on point of occurrance of the CPATH variable (see zxid.h)

/*(c) Branding button image URL for user interfaces
 * IdP BUTTON_URL is (may be) shown in SP IdP selection screens as
 * a button (provided that IDP_LIST_METH=2 (IDP_LIST_BRAND)) that
 * user can click to login using that IdP.
 *
 * SP BUTTON_URL is shown by IdP login screen so user understands which SP
 * requested the SSO. In this use, the "button" is not (usually?) clickable.
 *
 * BUTTON_URL will also appear in metadata as Organization/OrganizationURL,
 * see symlabs-saml-displayname-2008.pdf (submitted to OASIS SSTC) for
 * specification.
 *
 * The BUTTON_URL MUST contain substring "saml2_icon" and size designator (see spec),
 * to distinguish it from other uses of SAML2 MD Organization/OrganizationURL (which
 * are unspecified, but presumably include home page URL; original SAML2 MD spec
 * was too loose). ZXID only supports the usage as button image URL (as of 20111210).
 * BUTTON_URL is typically absolute URL (relative would not make sense as it
 * is referenced from other web site referring to your web site).
 *
 * Typical value::  https://your-site.com/YOUR_BRAND_saml2_icon_150x60.png
 *
 * Other possible values:: Depending on SP user interface, you may
 *     use any of
 *
 *       https://your-site.com/your_brand_saml2_icon_468x60.png
 *       https://your-site.com/your_brand_saml2_icon_150x60.png

 *     PREF_BUTTON_SIZE config option. Check with your Trust Operator
 *     organization to understand the convention they use.
 *
 *     > N.B. As of 20111210, you can only specify one in configuration and
 *     > your own metadata, but any number are tolerated in foreign metadata.

 * The VURL allows different BURL for different

 *
 * In VURL each ordinary letter is rendered as is, but the

 *       you do not need %p or %P).
 *   %p  the contents of environment variable SERVER_PORT (see CGI spec).
 *   %P  Similar to %p, but renders a colon before the portnumber, unless
 *       the SERVER_PORT is 443 or 80, in which case nothing is rendered.
 *       This deals with default ports of the https and http protocols.

 * or it can be fetched "on the fly" using the well known location (WKL)
 * method.
 *
 * MD_FETCH:: controls whether fetching is performed. This necessitates
 *     that ZXID was linked with libcurl. If you do not enable fetching, you
 *     will need to populate the cache manually, perhaps by using a web browser
 *     to fetch the meta data xml files from well known location URLs (or other
 *     URLs if you know better) and then running on commandline zxcot -a.
 *     Or you could use zxidcot.pl?op=md or zxcot(1) tool.
 *
 *     N.B. Even if fetching is enabled, the fetch can still fail due to
 *     network connectivity issues or due to other end not supporting it.
 *     
 *     MD_FETCH=1:: Fetch from WKL (Auto-CoT)
 *     MD_FETCH=2:: Fetch from metadata authority, see MD_AUTHORITY, below.
 *
 * MD_POPULATE_CACHE:: controls whether ZXID will write the metadata to
 *     the on-disk cache. This requires ZXID_MD_FETCH to be enabled
 *     and the file system permissions of the cache directory
 *     (e.g. /var/zxid/cot) to allow writing.
 *
 * MD_CACHE_FIRST:: controls whether cache will be checked before fetching
 *     is attempted. If cache misses, ZXID_MD_FETCH governs whether fetch
 *     is tried.
 *
 * MD_CACHE_LAST:: If true, metadata is obtained from cache
 *     if fetch was disabled or failed.
 *
 * If you want to control manually your CoT (e.g. because human process is
 * needed to verify that all the paperwork is in place), set MD_FETCH to 0.
