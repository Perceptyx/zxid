The research leading to these results has received funding from the
European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under
grant agreement number 216287 (TAS3 - Trusted Architecture for Securely
Shared Services - www.tas3.eu). However, most of the results were
produced outside the project or after it had ended.
