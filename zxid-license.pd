96.1 Dependency Library Licenses
--------------------------------

ZXID strives to maintain IPR hygiene and avoid both
non-free and GPL license contamination. All the
dependency libraries have BSD style licenses

* OpenSSL under BSDish (with "advertising" clause)
* libcurl under BSDish
* zlib under BSDish
* libc available as part of the operating system

Please see each library package for the exact details of their
licenses.

96.2 Specification IPR
----------------------

ZXID is based on open SAML and Liberty specifications. The parties
that have developed these specifications, including Symlabs, have made
Royalty Free (RF) licensing commitment. Please ask OASIS and Liberty
Alliance for the specifics of their IPR policies and IPR disclosures.

Some protocols, such as WS-Trust and WS-Federation enjoy Microsoft's
pledge<<footnote: If you have a reference to where this pledge can be
found, please let me know so it can be included here.>> that they will
not sue you even if you implement these specifications. You should
evaluate yourself whether this is good enough for your situation.

96.3 Further Warranties
-----------------------

If you need the author or Symlabs to further disclaim IPR interest or
make warranties of non-infringement, such declarations are
available for a fee. Please contact sales@symlabs.com

Legal queries and clarifications will be answered at then-current
Symlabs Professional Services rate, please contact sales@symlabs.com.

96.4 TAS3 Free to Implement and Use Pledge
------------------------------------------

Per decisions of TAS3 General Assembly of 2010-09-13\\
(TAS3_General_Assembly_minutes_2010_09_13_Leuven_V03.doc), following
declaration was made:

> TAS3 architecture and specifications, as described in public
> deliverables D2.1, D2.4, and D7.1, are licensed free for
> implementation and use by anyone. Up to June 2010, TAS3 consortium
> partners do not hold patents nor will exercise patents that cover
> implementation and use of the TAS3 architecture and specifications of
> those deliverables. This license is only granted for the specific
> purpose of correct implementations of TAS3 specifications.

For further openness, it should be noted that ZXID, which is
distributed under Apache2 open source license, is the Reference
Implementation of the TAS3 Core Security Architecture, i.e. from
software licensing perspective TAS3 is available in open source. Many
other components of TAS3 are available in open source as well.
