 ** 30.5.2006, created, Sampo Kellomaki (sampo@iki.fi)
 ** 6.8.2006,  factored data structure walking to aux-templ.c --Sampo
 ** 8.8.2006,  reworked namespace handling --Sampo
 ** 26.8.2006, some CSE --Sampo
 ** 23.9.2006, added WO logic --Sampo
 ** 30.9.2007, improvements to WO encoding --Sampo
 ** 8.2.2010,  better handling of schema order encoding of unknown namespace prefixes --Sampo
 ** 27.10.2010, re-engineered namespace handling --Sampo
 ** 24.11.2010, this code is sceduled for removal as el_order processing in WO encoder accomplishes the same result. --Sampo
