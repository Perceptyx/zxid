  -i N             Pick Nth detected decodable structure, default: 1=first
  -s               Enable signature validation step (reads config from -c, see below)
  -s -s            Only validate hashes (check canon), do not fetch meta or check RSA
  -r               Decode and validate already decoded SAML2 reponse, e.g. from audit trail
