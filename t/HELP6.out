       zxumacall [options] -a IDP USER:PW -t SVCTYPE <req >resp
       zxumacall [options] -ua IDP UAT    -t SVCTYPE <req >resp
       zxumacall [options] -a IDP USER:PW -t SVCTYPE -nd # Discovery only
       zxumacall [options] -a IDP USER:PW   # Authentication only
       zxumacall [options] -dynclireg az_entity # Dynamic Client Registration
       zxumacall [options] -s SESID -im EID # Identity Mapping to EID
       zxumacall [options] -s SESID -l      # List session cache
  -c CONF          Optional configuration string (default -c CPATH=/var/zxid/)

  -s SESID         Session ID referring to a directory in /var/zxid/ses
                   Use zxidhlo to do SSO and then cut and paste from there.
  -a IDP USER:PW   Use Authentication service to authenticate the user and
                   create session. IDP is IdP's Entity ID. This is alternative to -s
  -t SVCTYPE       Service Type URI. Used for discovery. Mandatory (omitting -t
                   causes authorization only mode, provided that -az was specified).

  -nidmap DSTEID   Map session's login identity to identity at some other SP using SAML
  -e ODY           Pass request body as argument (default is to read from STDIN)
